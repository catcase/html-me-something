                    <p>I used to have a lot more free time than I do now, but with what little I do have,I really enjoy painting. I took a lot of art classes in school, but was never really good with pencil or charcoal or any kind of shading for that matter. That's not to say that I wasn't good at drawing, but more so just really bad at realistic things. You know, like those fruit bowl still life pictures they wanted you to copy? I even remember doing tree trunks. Booooring.</p>

                    <p>Anyway, I guess I first dabbled with acrylics about nine years ago. I painted some solid-colored pictures of Star Wars characters on some cardboard,and they turned out suprisingly well. Ever since, I just played around with ideas more and more. Those eventually led to some cool 8-bit's I did, and then slowly into some more complicated pieces, one of which was shaded. Trust me, I'm still shocked by that one. After a while, I had friends and family wanting commissioned pieces, and then it made me realize that I don't have to be good at drawing apples to be good at another type of art.</p>
